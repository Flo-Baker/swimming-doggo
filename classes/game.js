// 1. clearing the canvas

/* 2. movement of the elements 
=> elements: dog, sticks, seals
=> other things to consider: 
    - collisions for score (sticks) and game stop (3x seals)
    - removing canvas when game stopped
    - appearance of gameoverScreen
    (- reappearance of canvas when game is restarted?!)

// 3. drawing the neccessary elements in the canvas (bg img, dog, sticks, seals)
// 4. request animation
